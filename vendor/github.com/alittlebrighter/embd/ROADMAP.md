# embd roadmap

The following features are planned (in no particular order):

* A fully featured cli tool (**embd**)
* Support for UART, SPI
* Support for a whole range of sensors/controllers
* Support for Intel Galileo (will require a few changes to Golang, but not unsurmountable)
* Support for a lot of other ARM prototyping boards (Cubietruck, Radxa, etc.)
* Awesome documentation
* A embd UI (similar to the Arduino IDE)
* Supporting something other than Linux
* Support for vision processing (OpenCV ?)
* Allow remote instrumentation of the host via network/web sockets/etc.
